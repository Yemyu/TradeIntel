# TradeShock AI

An evidence-grounded AI assistant for analysing trade-policy shocks and trade diversion.

## Current status

Learning and development stage 2: the first 48-month policy-linked trade panel has been validated, loaded into a local MySQL database, and reconciled against the source CSV.

This repository is currently local-only. It will not be published until its scope, documentation, and privacy have been reviewed.

## Local environment

The project uses Python 3.12 in a project-local virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python --version
```

No third-party Python packages are required in stage 0.

## First validated policy source

The initial historical case is the U.S. Section 301 List 1 action effective 6 July 2018. Reproduce the official tariff-code extraction with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/download_policy_sources.py
python -m src.policy.extract_ustr_list1
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The extraction retains the original `9033.00` entry and applies the later official correction to `9033.00.90` with source-page provenance.

## First trade-data inventory

Place the official July 2018 Census archive temporarily at `data/raw/trade/IMDB1807.ZIP`, then run:

```bash
python scripts/inventory_census_import.py
```

The script streams the fixed-width detail member, filters to the audited List 1 codes, and writes a compact origin summary, a product-origin-month aggregate, and an inventory report. It does not estimate a policy effect.

The processed outputs record the official source URL, filename, byte size, retrieval time, and SHA-256 checksum. The raw ZIP is not required to remain in the project after successful processing; see [`data/README.md`](./data/README.md).

## Multi-month panel

The resumable pipeline processes one month at a time and removes each raw ZIP after successful processing:

```bash
python scripts/build_trade_panel.py --start 2016-01 --end 2019-12
```

It writes one generated CSV per month under `data/processed/trade/monthly/`, a 48-month source manifest, and a combined `trade_import_monthly.csv`. The full generated panel is intentionally ignored by Git; the one-month sample remains as the readable example.

## Descriptive policy baseline

Join the verified Section 301 event and product list to the local 48-month panel:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_policy_case.py
```

This writes a monthly before/transition/after table, an origin-level change table, and a JSON summary under `data/processed/analysis/`. It is explicitly descriptive and does not claim a causal tariff effect.
